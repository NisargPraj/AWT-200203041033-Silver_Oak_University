							One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the 
							darkness bind them.
							In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, The Dark Lord, 
							forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One 
							Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. 
							After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit.

						Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling 
						Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost 
						the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, 
						tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked 
						by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone, that is, save for the 
						mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.
